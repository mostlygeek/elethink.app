                <h2>What is Elethink?</h2>
                
                <p>Elethink is an iOS app for discovering and practicing cognitive strategies to quickly improve a low mood. It is inspired by CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) techniques with tools for recording your moments, thoughts, and feelings.  Developing a habit of recording your moments helps build insight into your behaviors and ultimately how to change them.  Elethink makes building those habits quicker and easier. </p>
                
                <h2>How do I try it?</h2>
                
                <p>Elethink is available for free as a beta.</p>
                
                <p>Our goal is to help people build the skills to quickly reduce the effects of negative and irrational thoughts.  We're still learning what's effective in the app and what needs more work.  To accomplish our goal we will build a community that will help create the most effective app for developing healthier thinking habits.</p>
